# awsborn

This Gem lets you define and launch a server cluster on Amazon EC2.
The `launch` operation is idempotent, i.e., it only launches instances
that are not running.

## Installation

    gem install awsborn

## Synopsis

    #! /usr/bin/env ruby

    require 'rubygems'
    require 'awsborn'

    # If not set, will be picked up from ENV['AMAZON_ACCESS_KEY_ID']
    Awsborn.access_key_id = 'AAAAAAAAAAAA'
    # Can be picked up from ENV['AMAZON_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY'] or Keychain (OS X)
    Awsborn.secret_access_key = 'KKKKKKKKKKKK'

    # Logs to `awsborn.log` in current dir with level INFO by default.
    # To suppress logging, do `Awsborn.logger = Logger.new('/dev/null')`
    Awsborn.logger.level = Logger::DEBUG

    class LogServer < Awsborn::Server
      instance_type    :m1_small
      image_id         'ami-2fc2e95b', :sudo_user => 'ubuntu'
      security_group   'Basic web'
      keys             'keys/*.pub'
      bootstrap_script 'chef-bootstrap.sh'
      monitor          true
    end

    log_servers = LogServer.cluster do
      domain 'releware.net'
      server :log_a, :zone => :eu_west_1a, :disk => {:sdf => "vol-a857b8c1"}, :ip => 'log-a'
      server :log_b, :zone => :eu_west_1b, :disk => {:sdf => "vol-aa57b8c3"}, :ip => 'log-b'
    end

    log_servers.launch

    log_servers.each do |server|
      system "rake cook server=#{server.host_name}"
    end

## How it works

It's really simple:

1. Define a server type (`LogServer` in the example above).
2. Define a cluster of server instances.
3. Launch the cluster.

See *Launching a cluster* below for details.

### Defining a server type

Server types can be named anything but must inherit from `Awsborn::Server`.
Servers take five different directives:

* `instance_type` -- a symbol.  One of `:m1_small`, `:m1_large`, `:m1_xlarge`,
  `:m2_2xlarge`, `:m2_4xlarge`, `:c1_medium`, `:c1_xlarge`, `cc1.4xlarge`, and `t1.micro`.
* `image_id` -- a valid EC2 AMI or a hash `{:i386 => 'ami-3232', :x64 => 'ami-6464'}`
  Specify `:sudo_user` as an option if the AMI does not allow you to log in as root.
* `security_group` -- a security group that you own.
* `keys` -- one or more globs to public ssh key files.  When the servers are running,
  `root` will be able to log in using any one of these keys.
* `bootstrap_script` -- path to a script which will be run on each instance as
  soon as it is started.  Use it to bootstrap `chef` and let `chef` take it from
  there.  A sample bootstrap script is included towards the end of this document.

A server cannot be started without `instance_type`, `image_id` and `security_group`.
The don't have to be defined for the server type though, but can
equally well be added as options to the specific servers.

### Defining a cluster

The `cluster` method accepts three commands, `domain`, `load_balancer` and `server`.
`domain` is optional and is just a way to avoid repetition in the `server` commands.
`load_balancer` is also optional and take a name and a hash. `server` takes a name
(which can be used as a key in the cluster, e.g. `log_servers[:log_a]`)
and a hash:

Mandatory keys for server:

* `:zone` -- the availability zone for the server.  Expressed as symbols, e.g.
  `:us_east_1d`, `:us_west_1a`, `:eu_west_1c`, `:ap-southeast-1a`, `:ap-northeast-1b`.
* `:disk` -- a hash of `device => volume-id`.  Awsborn uses the disks to tell if a server
  is running or not (see *Launching a cluster*).  `volume-id` can also be an array
  `[volume-id, :format]`, in which case `the_server.format_disk_on_device?(device)`
  will return `true`.  See `contrib/cookbooks/ec2-ebs` for example usage.

Optional keys for server:

* `:ip` -- a domain name which translates to an elastic ip.  If the domain name does not
  contain a full stop (dot) and `domain` has been specified above, the domain is added.

Keys that override server type settings:

* `:instance_type`
* `:sudo_user`
* `:security_group`
* `:keys`
* `:bootstrap_script`
* `:image_id`

Mandatory keys for load_balancer:

* `:region` -- the region covered by the load balancer. One of `:us_east_1`, `:us_west_1`,
  `:eu_west_1`, `:ap_southeast_1`, `:ap_northeast_1`

Optional keys for load_balancer:

* `:dns_alias` -- a domain name to be tied to the load balancer in Route 53.
    May be a simple name (`www`) in which case the cluster domain will be added,
    or a full domain name.
* `:only` -- a list of server names to which the load balancer is
	restricted.
* `:except` -- a list of servers that the load balancer should ignore.
* `:health_check` -- a hash containing full or partial health check
  configuration. Health check can contain `:healthy_threshold`,
  `:unhealthy_threshold`, `:target`, `:timeout` and `:interval`
* `:listeners` -- a list of listener definitions for the load balancer. For instance:
    `{ :protocol => :http, :load_balancer_port => 80,  :instance_port => 80 }`
* `:sticky_cookies` -- a list of ports/cookie policies that the load balancer
	should take care of. There are three kinds of available policies:
	`:disabled`,
	`:app_generated` (the cookie is generated by the app) or
	`:lb_generated` (the cookie is generated by the load balancer).

Example:

    cluster "test" do
      domain 'yourdomain.net'
      load_balancer 'test-balancer',
        :region => :eu_west_1,
        :only => [:cluster_test_1, :cluster_test_2],
        :health_check => {
          :target => 'HTTP:80/index.html',
          :timeout => 6,
          :interval => 31,
          :unhealthy_threshold => 3,
          :healthy_threshold => 9
        },
        :listeners => [
          { :protocol => :http, :load_balancer_port => 80,  :instance_port => 80},
          { :protocol => :tcp,  :load_balancer_port => 443, :instance_port => 443}
        ],
        :sticky_cookies => [
          { :ports => [80], :policy => :disabled }
          #{ :ports => [80], :policy => :app_generated, :cookie_name => 'some_cookie' }
          #{ :ports => [80], :policy => :lb_generated, :expiration_period => 10 * 60 }
        ]
      server :cluster_test_1, :zone => :eu_west_1a, :disk => {:sdf => "vol-12345678"}, :instance_type => :m1_small
      server :cluster_test_2, :zone => :eu_west_1a, :disk => {:sdf => "vol-09876543"}, :instance_type => :m1_small
    end

### Launching a cluster

The `launch` method on the cluster checks to see if each server is running by checking
if the server's disks are attached to an EC2 instance, i.e., the server is
defined by its content, not by its AMI or ip address.

Servers that are not running are started by calling the `start` method on the server,
which does the following:

    def start (key_pair)
      launch_instance(key_pair)

      update_known_hosts
      install_ssh_keys(key_pair) if keys

      if elastic_ip
        associate_address
        update_known_hosts
      end

      bootstrap if bootstrap_script
      attach_volumes
    end

The `key_pair` is a temporary key pair that is used only for launching this cluster.
In case of a failed launch, the private key is available as `/tmp/temp_key_*`.

### Supplying user-data

Instances can be supplied user-data at launch, which can be used to integrate
with e.g. cloud-init or similar. See http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/AWSEC2/2007-03-01/DeveloperGuide/AESDG-chapter-instancedata.html

In Awsborn, you can supply user-data by defining a user_data instance method on the
Server class which must return a string.

    class LogServer < Awsborn::Server
      instance_type    :m1_small
      image_id         'ami-2fc2e95b', :sudo_user => 'ubuntu'
      security_group   'Basic web'
      keys             '../keys/*'
      bootstrap_script 'chef-bootstrap.sh'
      monitor          true

      cluster do
        domain 'releware.net'
        server :log_a, :zone => :eu_west_1a, :disk => {:sdf => "vol-a857b8c1"}, :ip => 'log-a'
        server :log_b, :zone => :eu_west_1b, :disk => {:sdf => "vol-aa57b8c3"}, :ip => 'log-b'
      end

      def user_data
        "hostname=#{name}"
      end
    end

## A bootstrapping script

This is what we use with the AMI above:

    #!/bin/bash

    echo '------------------'
    echo 'Bootstrapping Chef'
    echo

    aptitude -y update
    aptitude -y install gcc g++ curl build-essential \
      libxml-ruby libxml2-dev \
      ruby irb ri rdoc ruby1.8-dev libzlib-ruby libyaml-ruby libreadline-ruby \
      libruby libruby-extras libopenssl-ruby \
      libdbm-ruby libdbi-ruby libdbd-sqlite3-ruby \
      sqlite3 libsqlite3-dev libsqlite3-ruby

    curl -L 'http://rubyforge.org/frs/download.php/69365/rubygems-1.3.6.tgz' | tar zxf -
    cd rubygems* && ruby setup.rb --no-ri --no-rdoc

    ln -sfv /usr/bin/gem1.8 /usr/bin/gem

    gem install chef ohai --no-ri --no-rdoc --source http://gems.opscode.com --source http://gems.rubyforge.org

    echo
    echo 'Bootstrapping Chef - done'
    echo '-------------------------'

## Running with Chef Solo

Awsborn integrates with [Chef Solo](http://github.com/opscode/chef).  An example from reality:

    Awsborn.access_key_id = 'AKIAJHL53MPX7LPCKIFQ'

    class LogServer < Awsborn::Server
      instance_type    :m1_small
      image_id         'ami-2fc2e95b', :sudo_user => 'ubuntu'
      security_group   'Basic web'
      keys             '../keys/*'
      bootstrap_script 'chef-bootstrap.sh'
      monitor          true

      cluster do
        domain 'releware.net'
        server :log_a, :zone => :eu_west_1a, :disk => {:sdf => "vol-a857b8c1"}, :ip => 'log-a'
        server :log_b, :zone => :eu_west_1b, :disk => {:sdf => "vol-aa57b8c3"}, :ip => 'log-b'
      end

      cluster :test do
        domain 'releware.net'
        server :test, :zone => :eu_west_1b, :disk => {:sdf => "vol-abababab"}, :ip => 'log-test'
      end

      def chef_dna
        {
          :user => "lumberjack",
          :host => host_name,
          :users =>  [
            {
              :username => "lumberjack",
              :authorized_keys => key_data,
              :gid => 1001,
              :uid => 1001,
              :sudo => true,
            }
          ],
          :packages => %w[
            vim
            heirloom-mailx
          ],
          :gems => [
            "rake"
          ],
          :ebs_volumes => [
            {:device => "sdf", :path => "/apps"}
          ],
          :recipes => [
            "packages",
            "users",
            "sudo",
            "openssh",
            "ec2-ebs",
            "git",
            "gems",
            "lumberjack"
          ]
        }
      end
    end

Just add a `Rakefile` in the same directory:

    require 'awsborn'
    include Awsborn::Chef::Rake
    require './servers'

Put your cookbooks directory in the same directory as the `Rakefile` or in its
parent directory.  Run `rake` to start all servers and run Chef on each of them.
Other rake tasks include:

* `rake chef` - Run chef on all servers, or the ones specified with `host=name1,name2`.
* `rake chef:debug` - Ditto, but with chef's log level set to `debug`.
* `rake start` - Start all servers (or host=name1,name2) but don't run `chef`.
* `rake start cluster=test` - Start the servers in the named cluster.  Default is the first unnamed cluster.


## Bugs and surprising features

* There is a race condition in launch: Immediately after the launch request (`launch_instance`) we
  call `instance_running?`, but occasionally, AWS will not recognise the instance id yet
  (`InvalidInstanceID.NotFound: The instance ID 'i-e9005283' does not exist`)
* Running with `rake` suppresses stack traces which makes it hard to debug rare errors.  The rake
  tasks or entry points should catch exceptions and print the stack trace.
* `t1_micro` instances will select an i386 image when `image_id` is specified as a hash.  To run
  them with x64 images, specify the image name on the server directive.

### Untested features

* Launching without ssh keys.  (I suppose certain AMIs would support that.)

## To do / Could do

* Tests.
* Dynamic discovery of instance types and availability zones.
* Hack RightAws to verify certificates.
* Elastic Load Balancing.
* Launch servers in parallel.


## Note on Patches/Pull Requests

* Fork the project.
* Make your feature addition or bug fix.
* Add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a
  future version unintentionally.
* At the moment, the gem does not have much tests.  I intend to fix that,
  and I won't accept patches without tests.
* Commit, do not mess with rakefile, version, or history.
  (if you want to have your own version, that is fine but bump version in a commit by itself I can ignore when I pull)
* Send me a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.

## Changes

### New in 0.8.1

* Specify health_check for load balancers.

### New in 0.8.0

* Server cluster can have load balancers.

### New in 0.7.0

  This security group is created on the fly if it doesn't exist.
* Server clusters can have names.

### New in 0.6.0

* Uses `right_aws` version 2.

### New in 0.5.4, 0.5.5

* Run `rake list` to see a list of running servers.

### New in 0.5.2, 0.5.3

* Run `rake upgrade_chef host=foo` to upgrade chef on server `foo`.

### New in 0.5.1

* When awsborn uploads cookbooks and configuration, it looks for a `cookbooks`
  directory in the parent directory if none is found in the `Rakefile`'s directory.

### New in 0.5.0

* Support for cc1.4xlarge and t1.micro instance types.

## History

This gem is inspired by [Awsymandias](http://github.com/bguthrie/awsymandias)
which was sort of what I needed but was too complicated to fix, partly because
the documentation was out of date.  Big thanks for the inspiration and random
code snippets.
